# Incentive System for Peer Review

The core of $QURE's utility lies in its ability to incentivize everyone in the ecosystem, starting with peer review. Reviewers are rewarded with a projectâ€™s $QURE tokens for their contributions to validating and enhancing bioscience research. This system accelerates the peer review process and ensures high-quality, reproducible research outcomes. $QURE tokens thus play a pivotal role in directing research attention and funding, empowering a decentralized, user-driven approach to scientific discovery.

Enablements:

* Decentralized Identity
* Decentralized Peer Review
