# Scalability Solutions

QURE Chain incorporates several scalability solutions from our core technology partners, Celestia and Polygon. We run mainnet validators but require our community to participate, stake enough $QURE, and run enough independent validators in the network to handle the high throughput demands of decentralized science applications without compromising speed or security.  QURE Chain is modular and ERC-20 based as well as Solidity/EVM, making the transition to new or superior ZK-enabled L1 or L2 blockchains a future-proof upgrade path.

Enablements:

* High Throughput: Facilitates more transactions per second, which is crucial for scaling applications like peer reviews and data sharing.
* Reduced Latency: Improves transaction processing speeds, enhancing user experience.
* Isolated Testing: Sidechains can test new features without impacting the main network.
