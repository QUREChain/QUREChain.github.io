# Scalability Solutions

QURE Chain incorporates several scalability solutions, including state channels and sidechains, to handle the high throughput demands of decentralized science applications without compromising speed or security.

Enablements:

* High Throughput: Facilitates more transactions per second, which is crucial for scaling applications like peer reviews and data sharing.
* Reduced Latency: Improves transaction processing speeds, enhancing user experience.
* Isolated Testing: Sidechains can test new features without impacting the main network.
