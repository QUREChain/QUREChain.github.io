# DeSci Layer 2 - Liquid, Native Yield

QURE Chain draws inspiration from Manta Pacific, the world’s first modular execution layer for ZK applications.  QURE Chain will provide 80% cheaper transaction costs as a rollup and implement HealthZK, allowing zkApps without needing advanced cryptography knowledge or learning new zkDSLs.  QURE Chain leverages Celestia’s modular data availability, delivering fast infrastructure at a fraction of the cost of typical L2s.  Speed, low cost, and the support of HealthZK make the perfect environment for building and launching biopharmaceutical dapps.

QURE Chain is supported by its validators which stake $QURE with asset-backed collateral, BRICS Bonds (or other assets) such as short-duration US Treasuries (T-Bills) with an average duration of 60 days or less.  Collateral can be composed by any of the following instruments:  BRICS bonds or treasury bills, treasury notes with near maturity, money market funds investing in short-term treasuries, Treasury ETFs and even Reverse Repurchase Agreements collateralized with US Treasuries.
