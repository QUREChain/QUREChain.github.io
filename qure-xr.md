# Qure XR

User adoption and utility for blockchain applications have traditionally been low. Barriers to entry are usually attributed to the difficulty of using the technology, much like in science, where expert knowledge and training are required.

[QURE Chain](http://qurechain.com/) Uses [QURE XR](http://qurexr.com/), an Extended Reality (XR) content creation platform for Scientists. Virtual Reality, or VR, is an experience in a wholly virtualized world, whereas Extended Reality, or XR, mixes the real-world experience with digital, virtual experiences and interfaces.  For any content creation that involves the real world, XR technology like Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 enable the best of both worlds and bring data, information, and interactivity into a fully immersive experience.  The XR experience allows scientists, patients, and caregivers to interact in an enriching, easy-to-use environment with exponentially more information than words or images on paper, mobile applications,  or web browser experiences.

XR technology captures and conveys more information than any other medium with real-time, interactive visual stimulus and simulated physical presence and action – everything you experience as a human.  Researchers engaging in discovery, clinical trials with patients and caregivers following a procedure – everything done in biopharmaceutical research involves immense physical action and the information to be captured and reviewed.  Techniques in research conveyed through XR and other virtual systems bestow accelerated learning and communication – and up to 90% retention in training and education.

In QURE XR, artificial intelligence will play a critical role in scientific research using computer vision and machine learning in laboratory and clinical settings.  QURE XR leverages knowledge from the community and the blockchain, giving the embedded AI systems massive economies of scale across all researchers, patients, and caregivers' data and lab information.  Qure XR, combined with QURE Chain and HealthZK, our zero-knowledge proof framework, makes a powerful combination for a wholly transparent and intelligent clinical research and drug discovery and development platform.  AIs can utilize zero-knowledge proofs to access and act accurately upon private data without disclosure.  QURE is a holistic, decentralized ecosystem where cures can be discovered and developed faster and easier, with more transparency than traditional systems, using this unique blend of XR, AI, Zero-Knowledge proofs, and blockchain.

Scientific discovery revolves around the traditional Peer Review system. QURE Chain and $QURE turbo-charge the peer review process, accelerating the rate at which drugs enter and exit clinical trials with our system of peer review smart contracts and DeFi incentives.
