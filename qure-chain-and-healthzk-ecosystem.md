# QURE Chain & HealthZK Ecosystem

$QURE utilizes the HealthZK Framework (zero-knowledge with artificial intelligence) to enhance privacy and scalability within the ecosystem. This framework supports native zero-knowledge operations on the blockchain, ensuring efficient and transparent processing of complex computations necessary for peer reviews and data validation while maintaining anonymity and security with automation powered by artificial intelligence.

The QURE Chain offers HealthZK applications the fastest ZK-proving speed of any layer 1 blockchain. This provides an unrivaled user experience with low cost, just like any inexpensive L2 transaction, but performed on the L1 level, offering more decentralization. Developer toolkits for HealthZK make it easy to build and deploy applications with zero risk of exposing sensitive information using ZK features without the complexity.





Enablements:

* Decentralized Zero-Knowledge and AI Compute for Biotech & Healthcare
* Patient Health Information Marketplace
* Decentralized Clinical Trials
