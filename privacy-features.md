QURE Chain leverages Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to provide privacy for sensitive scientific data while ensuring transparency where necessary. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining patient confidentiality and protecting proprietary research data.

Enablements:

* Confidential Transactions: These enable transactions whose validity is verifiable without revealing underlying data, which is essential for sensitive scientific information.
* Selective Disclosure: Allows participants to reveal specific data points as needed without exposing entire datasets.
* Trust and Compliance: Helps meet regulatory compliance for handling sensitive information, crucial for clinical and biomedical research.
