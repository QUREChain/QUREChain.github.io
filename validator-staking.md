# Validator Staking

QURE Chain operates on a Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus model, emphasizing energy efficiency and scalability while ensuring high security. Stakeholders of $QURE tokens can participate as validators, securing the network by validating blocks and transactions.  Validators are also responsible for staking bonded tokens, yQURE, and yield-bearing QURE tokens that form the basis of the incentive systems combined with BRICS bonds native yields.

Enablements:

* Increased Network Participation: Lowering barriers like significant computational power requirements allows for broader participation in the network's consensus activities.
* Energy Efficiency: Reduces the environmental impact compared to Proof of Work systems by eliminating energy-intensive mining processes.
* Enhanced Security: Incentivizes validators through staking rewards to maintain network integrity and prevent malicious activities.
* Economic Security: Validators participating in yQURE staking with BRICS bonds provide stability and rewards
