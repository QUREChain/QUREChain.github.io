# QURE Governance

Enablements:

* Protocol Upgrades: Stakeholders can vote on updates and changes to the blockchain protocol, ensuring continuous improvement.
* Funding Proposals: Community-driven initiatives can be funded through proposals and voting, promoting ecosystem growth.
* Policy Setting: The community can set essential policies like transaction fee structures and validator rewards.
